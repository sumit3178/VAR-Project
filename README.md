# Portfolio Risk Modeling with Value at Risk (VaR)

## Overview

This project implements a portfolio risk model in Python to quantify the market risk of a technology stock portfolio consisting of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN). It calculates the 1-day Value at Risk (VaR) at 95% and 99% confidence levels using both parametric (Variance-Covariance) and non-parametric (Historical Simulation) methods. Additionally, it employs Monte Carlo simulations to assess potential portfolio losses under simulated future market scenarios.

## Features

* Download historical stock price data using `yfinance`.
* Calculate daily returns for portfolio assets.
* Compute portfolio returns based on user-defined asset weights.
* Estimate 1-day VaR using:

  * Parametric (Variance-Covariance) method.
  * Historical Simulation method.
  * Monte Carlo Simulation method.
* Visualize VaR estimates with bar charts and loss distribution histograms.
* Support for extending to other stocks or portfolios.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* Libraries:

  * pandas
  * numpy
  * yfinance
  * matplotlib

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy yfinance matplotlib 
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Modify the portfolio tickers and weights if desired.
3. Run the Python script to:

   * Download historical price data.
   * Calculate portfolio returns.
   * Compute VaR estimates.
   * Generate visualizations.


## Results

The script outputs:

* Parametric VaR estimates at 95% and 99% confidence levels.
* Historical VaR estimates at 95% and 99% confidence levels.
* Monte Carlo simulated VaR estimates.
* Visual plots showing the VaR comparisons and simulated portfolio loss distribution.
